## Installation

- Manual: Download the source code and move only the addons folder into your project addons folder then enable plugin in Project -> Project Settings -> Plugins.

## Usage

This plugin provides a new resource `Vector2ArrayResource` which contains a property `data` of `PackedVector2Array` type.
The `Vector2ArrayResource` is a wrapper for `PackedVector2Array`.
When this resource is added to a node, and it is active, the plugin will provide functionality for easy editing data of the array.

### Example
- Add a property of `Vector2ArrayResource` to your node
```
@export var polygon: Vector2ArrayResource
```
- Then you can get `PackedVector2Array` from it like this:
```
func _ready():
    # setuping polygon for CollisionPolygon2D node
    collision_polygon_2d.polygon = polygon.data
```

There is an example scene in the `example` folder.
